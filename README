Lingua-NL-FactoidExtractor version 1.0
======================================

This module extracts structured facts (factoids) from running text. A factoid is a tuple of four elements: subject, verb, object and modifiers, in which the verb has been lemmatized and the object and modifier slots may be empty. As input, the factoid extractor takes text that has been syntactically parsed with the Dutch parser Alpino. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

USAGE

The script example.pl in this distribution illustrates the use of the module.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the Dutch Alpino-parser. Alpino is available under the conditions of the Gnu Lesser General Public License. See www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/alp/Alpino/

KNOWN ISSUES

If punctuation such as a full stop or a comma is glued to a word in the Alpino output then this punctuation also ends up in the factoids extracted from the sentence. Work-around is to use a tokenizer that separates punctuation from words by whitespace before parsing the sentence.
